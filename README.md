A user-friendly wallet to interact with the Polkadot/Substrate based blockchains through a browser. It allows users to access their Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem account(s), which can also be used to interact with decentralized apps. It is based on polkadot js extension, which injects a [@polkadot/api](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) signer into a page, along with any associated accounts.

Polkadot js Plus extension not only has all the abilities of the original Polkadot extension, but also many new functionalities as listed below are available, where more features are coming.

  - View balances (crypto/USD)
  - Transfer funds
  - View transaction history
  - View an address as QR code
  - Easy staking (Solo and Pool Staking)
  - Crowdloans (View Auctions and contribute to crowdloans)
  - Governance (vote referendums, second proposals, vote/unvote councils, propose treasury proposals and tips, etc.)
  - Social recovery
  - Supporting proxy accounts (for transferring, staking, and contribution to crowdloans)

2. got to downloaded folder via `cd polkadot-Js-Plus-extension`
3. install dependencies via `yarn` (yarn versin: 3.2.0)
4. append the following Westend network info to './node_modules/@substrate/ss58-registry/esm/index.js'):

     `{
		"prefix": 42,
		"network": "westend",
		"displayName": "Westend",
		"symbols": [
			"WND"
		],
		"decimals": [
			12
		],
		"standardAccount": "*25519",
		"website": "https://polkadot.network"
	}`
  
5. Build via `yarn build`
6. Install the extension
  - Chrome:
    - go to `chrome://extensions/`
    - ensure you have the Development flag set
    - "Load unpacked" and point to `packages/extension/build`
    - if developing, after making changes - refresh the extension
  - Firefox:
    - go to `about:debugging#addons`

### Testing

* To run unit tests, first install dependencies using `yarn` then use: `yarn test:plus`

* Test on Westend blockchain:

   - It is possible via the provided [add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkadot-js-plus-extension/). To receive some westies (Westend's native token) for a created account use [Westend Faucet](https://matrix.to/#/#westend_faucet:matrix.org)

   - Or build the extension on your own, but it needs to append the following Westend network info to './node_modules/@substrate/ss58-registry/esm/index.js') before build:

     `{
		"prefix": 42,
		"network": "westend",
		"displayName": "Westend",
		"symbols": [
			"WND"
		],
		"decimals": [
			12
		],
		"standardAccount": "*25519",
		"website": "https://polkadot.network"
	}`
